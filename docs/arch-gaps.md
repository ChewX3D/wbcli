# Architectural Gap Analysis

Reference document for planned refactoring. Each finding describes what is wrong,
why it matters, and how to fix it. Open findings are at the top. Resolved findings
are at the bottom for reference.

Severity scale: **high** | **medium** | **low**

---

## Dependency Direction Violations

---

## WhiteBIT Transport Client Mirror Rule Violations

### GAP-006 — `PlaceCollateralBulkLimitOrder` exists but nothing uses it
**Severity:** medium

**What is wrong:**

The transport client has a `PlaceCollateralBulkLimitOrder` method with tests, but:

- no port interface method exists for bulk orders
- no adapter method wraps it
- no service or command calls it

**Why it matters:**

The mirror rule says the client should have "nothing more and nothing less" than what
the product needs from the API. An unused transport method adds maintenance cost for
a feature that does not exist yet. Every time the client changes, this method and its
tests have to be kept in sync even though nothing uses them.

**Fix:**

Either wire it up fully (port method, adapter method, service, command) or remove it
until the feature is planned. Do not leave half-built vertical slices at the transport
layer.

---

## DRY Violations

### GAP-008 — `boolRef` helper is copy-pasted across two service packages
**Severity:** low

**What is wrong:**

The same helper function exists in two places:

```go
// internal/app/services/auth/login.go
// internal/app/services/collateral/place_order.go — identical copy
func boolRef(value bool) *bool {
    allocated := value
    return &allocated
}
```

**Why it matters:**

Duplicated code means two places to update if the pattern changes, and two places
where bugs can hide independently.

**Fix:**

Extract to a shared utility, for example `internal/ptrutil/ptrutil.go`.

---

## Concurrency Safety

### GAP-009 — `applicationFactory` global variable is not safe for parallel tests
**Severity:** low

**What is wrong:**

The application factory is stored in a package-level global variable:

```go
// cmd/application_runtime.go
var applicationFactory = appcontainer.NewDefault
```

`SetApplicationFactoryForTest` replaces this global without any locking.

**Why it matters:**

This works today because tests run sequentially. But if tests ever run in parallel
(for example with `go test -race ./...`), two tests replacing the same global at the
same time is a data race. The race detector will flag it.

**Fix:**

Remove the global. Pass the factory as a parameter into `newRootCmd`.
`NewRootCmdForTest()` already accepts a factory at construction — make the production
path work the same way. The `NewDefault` wiring lives in `main.go` and gets passed in,
never stored as a mutable global.

---

## Implementation Order

| Order | Finding | Reason |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | GAP-009 | Remove mutable global; pass factory as parameter |
| 2 | GAP-006 | Decide: wire bulk orders fully or remove dead code |
| 3 | GAP-008 | Extract `boolRef` to shared utility |

## Resolved

### GAP-001 — `internal/app/application/factory.go` imports concrete adapters
**Severity:** ~~high~~ — **closed, accepted as-is**

`internal/app/application/` is the composition root of this project. The composition
root must import all concrete adapter packages — that is its job. `NewDefault()` wires
`configstore`, `secretstore`, and `whitebit` adapters into services; this is correct
and intentional.

The remaining constructors (`New`, `NewWithUseCases`, `NewWithAuthServices`,
`NewWithServices`) accept interfaces only and are fully clean.

**Decision:** Keep `NewDefault()` in `factory.go`. `internal/app/application/` is the
one package inside `internal/` that is explicitly permitted to import concrete adapters,
because it IS the composition root.

---

### GAP-002 — `cmd/order/errors.go` imported WhiteBIT adapter directly
**Severity:** ~~high~~ — **resolved** (commit `c8f0b0f`)

`cmd/order/errors.go` imported the WhiteBIT adapter package to check error types from
a failed order. The command layer was reading WhiteBIT-specific error values — if the
adapter is ever replaced, the command code breaks for no reason.

**Resolution:** Introduced unified `ports.APIError` type. The WhiteBIT adapter now
converts transport errors into `*ports.APIError` at the boundary. The command layer
checks `errors.As(err, &apiErr)` — no adapter import needed.

---

### GAP-007 — Error classification helpers were copy-pasted across two packages
**Severity:** ~~high~~ — **resolved** as part of GAP-002 fix (commit `c8f0b0f`)

The same string-matching logic (`indicatesMissingEndpointAccess`, `extractErrorDetail`)
existed in both `cmd/order/errors.go` and `internal/adapters/whitebit/credential_verifier.go`.
The duplication happened because `cmd/order` bypassed the port boundary and had to
re-implement classification that the adapter already did.

**Resolution:** Fixing GAP-002 eliminated this. The helpers now live only in
`internal/adapters/whitebit/apierror.go`.

---

### GAP-003 — `cmd/auth/errors.go` imported `ErrNotLoggedIn` from service package
**Severity:** ~~low~~ — **resolved**

`cmd/auth/errors.go` imported the auth service package just to use `ErrNotLoggedIn`.
This error meant the same thing as `ports.ErrCredentialNotFound` — both produced the
identical user message: "not logged in; run wbcli auth login first".

**Resolution:** Deleted `ErrNotLoggedIn` entirely. `ports.ErrCredentialNotFound` is
the single error for "not logged in". Removed the `authservice` import from
`cmd/auth/errors.go` and deleted `internal/app/services/auth/errors.go`.

---

### GAP-004 — `SystemClock` lived in the service package instead of adapters
**Severity:** ~~low~~ — **resolved**

`SystemClock` was a concrete `ports.Clock` implementation living in the auth service
package. The composition root had to reach into a service package for an infrastructure
type (`authservice.SystemClock{}`).

**Resolution:** Renamed to `clock.Real` and moved to `internal/adapters/clock/real.go`.
The composition root now imports from adapters like every other concrete dependency.
Deleted `internal/app/services/auth/clock.go`.

---

### GAP-005 — `PostOnly + IOC` conflict check in the transport client
**Severity:** ~~medium~~ — **closed, not a violation**

The WhiteBIT API documents error code `37` specifically for the `postOnly=true` +
`ioc=true` combination. The client-side check mirrors a documented API constraint —
same category as validating enum values or required fields. It prevents a wasted HTTP
call for a request the API will definitely reject.

**Decision:** Keep the check in `CollateralLimitOrderRequest.validate()`. This is
transport-level input validation, not a business rule.
