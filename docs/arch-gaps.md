## WhiteBIT Transport Client Mirror Rule Violations

### GAP-010 — Missing `rpi` field on `CollateralLimitOrderRequest`
**Severity:** low

**What is wrong:**

The WhiteBIT API documents an `rpi` (boolean, optional) parameter on both the
collateral limit order and bulk limit order endpoints. Our `CollateralLimitOrderRequest`
struct does not have this field.

The `ErrPostOnlyIOCConflict` validation is also incomplete — API error code 37 covers
`ioc=true + postOnly=true` AND `ioc=true + rpi=true`, but without the `rpi` field we
can't validate the second combination.

**Fix:**

Add `RPI *bool json:"rpi,omitempty"` to `CollateralLimitOrderRequest`. Add a client-side
validation for `ioc+rpi` alongside the existing `ioc+postOnly` check.

---

### GAP-011 — Request envelope does not send `nonceWindow`
**Severity:** medium

**What is wrong:**

The official WhiteBIT Go SDK (`whitebit-exchange/go-sdk/options.go`) sends
`nonceWindow: true` by default in every authenticated request:

```go
// Official SDK — options.go
type AuthParams struct {
    Request     string `json:"request"`
    Nonce       int64  `json:"nonce"`
    NonceWindow bool   `json:"nonceWindow"`
}

func NewAuthParams(url string) AuthParams {
    return AuthParams{Nonce: time.Now().UnixMilli(), NonceWindow: true, Request: url}
}
```

Our `privateEnvelope` only sends `request` and `nonce` — no `nonceWindow` field.

**Why it matters:**

Without `nonceWindow: true`, the API uses strict monotonic nonce ordering — each request
must have a nonce higher than the previous one. With `nonceWindow: true`, the API
accepts any nonce within ±5 seconds of server time and only checks uniqueness. The
windowed mode is more resilient to clock drift and concurrent requests.

**Fix:**

Add `NonceWindow bool json:"nonceWindow"` to `privateEnvelope` and set it to `true`
in `nextPrivateEnvelope`.

---

### GAP-012 — Error response `code` field not included in error details
**Severity:** low

**What is wrong:**

The WhiteBIT API returns structured error responses with a numeric `code` field that
has specific meaning per endpoint:

```json
{"code": 37, "message": "Validation failed", "errors": {"ioc": ["..."]}}
```

Documented codes for the limit order endpoint: `30` (default), `31` (market), `32`
(amount), `33` (price), `36` (clientOrderId), `37` (ioc+postOnly/rpi).

Our `extractErrorMessage` in `client.go` parses `message` and `errors` but ignores the
`code` field. The numeric code never reaches the user or the error detail string.

**Why it matters:**

The `code` gives precise context about what went wrong. The `message` field is often
generic ("Validation failed") while `code` tells you exactly which validation rule
fired. Including it in the error detail string makes errors more actionable.

**Fix:**

In `extractErrorMessage`, read the `code` field from the JSON response and prepend it
to the returned message string (e.g. `"code 37: Validation failed: ioc: ..."`). No new
struct field needed — just include it in the text that already flows into `APIError.Details`.

---

## DRY Violations

### GAP-008 — `boolRef` helper is copy-pasted across two service packages
**Severity:** low

**What is wrong:**

The same helper function exists in two places:

```go
// internal/app/services/auth/login.go
// internal/app/services/collateral/place_order.go — identical copy
func boolRef(value bool) *bool {
    allocated := value
    return &allocated
}
```

**Why it matters:**

Duplicated code means two places to update if the pattern changes, and two places
where bugs can hide independently.

**Fix:**

Delete both `boolRef` copies. Create a generic `Ptr[T]` helper in
`internal/ptrutil/ptrutil.go` that works for any type:

```go
func Ptr[T any](v T) *T { return &v }
```

Replace `boolRef(true)` calls with `ptrutil.Ptr(true)`. The generic version also
covers future `*string`, `*int`, etc. pointer needs without new helpers.

---

## Concurrency Safety

### GAP-009 — `applicationFactory` global variable is not safe for parallel tests
**Severity:** low

**What is wrong:**

The application factory is stored in a package-level global variable:

```go
// cmd/application_runtime.go
var applicationFactory = appcontainer.NewDefault
```

`SetApplicationFactoryForTest` replaces this global without any locking.

**Why it matters:**

This works today because tests run sequentially. But if tests ever run in parallel
(for example with `go test -race ./...`), two tests replacing the same global at the
same time is a data race. The race detector will flag it.

**Fix:**

Remove the global. Pass the factory as a parameter into `newRootCmd`.
`NewRootCmdForTest()` already accepts a factory at construction — make the production
path work the same way. The `NewDefault` wiring lives in `main.go` and gets passed in,
never stored as a mutable global.

## Implementation Order

| Order | Finding | Reason |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | GAP-011 | Add `nonceWindow: true` to match official SDK behavior |
| 2 | GAP-010 | Add missing `rpi` field and complete ioc+rpi validation |
| 3 | GAP-012 | Include error `code` in detail string for actionable errors |
| 4 | GAP-009 | Remove mutable global; pass factory as parameter |
| 5 | GAP-008 | Delete `boolRef`, create generic `Ptr[T]` utility |

## Resolved

### GAP-001 — `internal/app/application/factory.go` imports concrete adapters
**Severity:** ~~high~~ — **closed, accepted as-is**

`internal/app/application/` is the composition root of this project. The composition
root must import all concrete adapter packages — that is its job. `NewDefault()` wires
`configstore`, `secretstore`, and `whitebit` adapters into services; this is correct
and intentional.

The remaining constructors (`New`, `NewWithUseCases`, `NewWithAuthServices`,
`NewWithServices`) accept interfaces only and are fully clean.

**Decision:** Keep `NewDefault()` in `factory.go`. `internal/app/application/` is the
one package inside `internal/` that is explicitly permitted to import concrete adapters,
because it IS the composition root.

---

### GAP-002 — `cmd/order/errors.go` imported WhiteBIT adapter directly
**Severity:** ~~high~~ — **resolved** (commit `c8f0b0f`)

`cmd/order/errors.go` imported the WhiteBIT adapter package to check error types from
a failed order. The command layer was reading WhiteBIT-specific error values — if the
adapter is ever replaced, the command code breaks for no reason.

**Resolution:** Introduced unified `ports.APIError` type. The WhiteBIT adapter now
converts transport errors into `*ports.APIError` at the boundary. The command layer
checks `errors.As(err, &apiErr)` — no adapter import needed.

---

### GAP-007 — Error classification helpers were copy-pasted across two packages
**Severity:** ~~high~~ — **resolved** as part of GAP-002 fix (commit `c8f0b0f`)

The same string-matching logic (`indicatesMissingEndpointAccess`, `extractErrorDetail`)
existed in both `cmd/order/errors.go` and `internal/adapters/whitebit/credential_verifier.go`.
The duplication happened because `cmd/order` bypassed the port boundary and had to
re-implement classification that the adapter already did.

**Resolution:** Fixing GAP-002 eliminated this. The helpers now live only in
`internal/adapters/whitebit/apierror.go`.

---

### GAP-003 — `cmd/auth/errors.go` imported `ErrNotLoggedIn` from service package
**Severity:** ~~low~~ — **resolved**

`cmd/auth/errors.go` imported the auth service package just to use `ErrNotLoggedIn`.
This error meant the same thing as `ports.ErrCredentialNotFound` — both produced the
identical user message: "not logged in; run wbcli auth login first".

**Resolution:** Deleted `ErrNotLoggedIn` entirely. `ports.ErrCredentialNotFound` is
the single error for "not logged in". Removed the `authservice` import from
`cmd/auth/errors.go` and deleted `internal/app/services/auth/errors.go`.

---

### GAP-004 — `SystemClock` lived in the service package instead of adapters
**Severity:** ~~low~~ — **resolved**

`SystemClock` was a concrete `ports.Clock` implementation living in the auth service
package. The composition root had to reach into a service package for an infrastructure
type (`authservice.SystemClock{}`).

**Resolution:** Renamed to `clock.Real` and moved to `internal/adapters/clock/real.go`.
The composition root now imports from adapters like every other concrete dependency.
Deleted `internal/app/services/auth/clock.go`.

---

### GAP-005 — `PostOnly + IOC` conflict check in the transport client
**Severity:** ~~medium~~ — **closed, not a violation**

The WhiteBIT API documents error code `37` specifically for the `postOnly=true` +
`ioc=true` combination. The client-side check mirrors a documented API constraint —
same category as validating enum values or required fields. It prevents a wasted HTTP
call for a request the API will definitely reject.

**Decision:** Keep the check in `CollateralLimitOrderRequest.validate()`. This is
transport-level input validation, not a business rule.

---

### GAP-006 — `PlaceCollateralBulkLimitOrder` exists but nothing uses it
**Severity:** ~~medium~~ — **closed, pre-built for planned ticket**

The bulk order transport method is pre-built for PROJ-2026-008 (range live submission
via collateral bulk order endpoint). It will be wired up when that ticket moves to
implementation.
